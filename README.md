# Classifying Animals
---
I build a model using the random forest algorithm to classify animals. The data
is from the ![UCI Machine Learning Repository] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/zoo).
The model achieves an accuracy of 100% on a testing set of 21 animals.  

There are 3 notebooks in this repository:  
1. Load and Explore Data, Initial Modeling  
2. Decision Tree Model  
3. Random Forest Model  

This is a link to my ![blog post](https://ericchan24.squarespace.com/blog/2018/1/27/classifying-animals-using-machine-learning)
on the project.  
This is a link to an ![interactive app made using Dash](https://animal-classifier.herokuapp.com/)
that shows the model in action.
